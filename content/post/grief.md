Your mom dying is going to be a shock, a sad series of goodbyes, a funeral, then a time of silence.

Grief will linger for a period, embrace it, it is the way you heal - cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you can.

Your dad and brother will go through similar experiences; the days and weeks right after a loss are more about practical things than emotional sense. Buy groceries, fix legal issues, hug friends; those are the things you do.

Then you each begin the journey of identity redefinition. Grief is as much about the version of you that died as it is about the person you lost. You grieve being the sons and partner of your mom, each individually, and together as a group.

What you must do, is watch them and offer support. Your brother, barring pathologies, should likely bounce back the fastest - but will still require guidelines. At his age, he is in the natural process of identify definition (who am I?), so his natural state of recovery will be in place. BUT he will need a new model/example since he is still learning life and trying on personalities. You can give him examples to emulate, and constantly remind him of mom's examples of good personality so he will incorporate good traits into his self actualization.

Dad will be a challenge, and is not your responsibility. He is a grown man and should have the tools to recover naturally. If he is emotionally healthy, he will come to a time of self-preservation in which he allows himself to step up and move on, at which point he will need encouragement and enthusiastic permission to move on. The potential pitfalls prior to that catharsis will be depression and deterioration into self destructive behaviors like alcohol and substance abuse. He must be gently encouraged to feel the loss of partner and identity, up to and including intentionally seeking out grief counseling. You can help him most with patience, and practical actions. You (and your friends, neighbors, and those nice women that may start appearing quietly) should help him with practical things while he recovers. Another pitfall for him is denial. "Popping back into normalcy too soon" is not good and requires grief counseling. But barring that, your best tool is VERY gentle reminders that your brother needs him, so that when he's ready, he has a sense of purpose.

As for you; be at peace.

It sounds like your mom is a pretty amazing person and she clearly raised amazing kids, if your brother is anything like you. You do not have to replace her, but you can honor her by looking into yourself and finding her. She has spent your entire life weaving examples, philosophies, and morality into your soul - and clearly she has helped you evolve into a compassionate, strong, and supportive individual.

Sit with her, whether she's responsive or not, and talk with her. Tell her you will be ok, and that everybody will be ok. Tell her you are like her and happy about that, tell her that she already knows you love her and you already know she loves you. If she can talk, ask her advice. If not, you know you already have it in your wiring. Her life, good and bad, is now your complete manual. That's her gift to you. Tell her you will follow her examples and even learn from her mistakes.

Finally, if you find yourself lost at any point, you have a compass that she built into your heart. Love. If a situation goes awry, or you don't know what to do, just stop - take a breath - and think about love. Love will guide you and help you. Should you argue with your brother about his behavior? No, tell him that you love him and just need reassurance. Should you yell at dad because he won't get up out of his sadness? No, just sit and ask him to express love to you about you, her, and all your family. Are you suddenly overwhelmed? Find the people who love you, they will reach out. Receive their love.

It's going to be ok. Pain is ok, it's not forever. Love is forever. Love her in person now, and in your heart for the rest of your life. You can do it, she's given you all the tools.
